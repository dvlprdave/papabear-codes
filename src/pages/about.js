                    Hi, I'm David. A self-taught Developer & father of two. This blog is a
                    catalog / notebook of all the things that have either confused me or
                    caught my interest in web development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My goal is to provide a place where I can share pieces of what I've learned
                    and spread it to all.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I genuinly hope you enjoy your stay and take a good wealth from it. ✌️
                </p>
