CSS in JavaScript doesn't hold an amazing reception, yet here we are, doing exactly that. There's good 
reason for it though and now we're doing it in style. (silence fills the room as a tear is shed for my 
horrible attempt at a funny)

Let's take a quick surface look at styled components while using this header component as an example:

```javascript
const Header = styled.div`
    display: flex;
    background: #fff;
    color: #000;
    height: 10rem;
    padding: 0.5rem;
`
```

If you've never seen a styled component before, you are either confused or curious. Either way, 
you should at least be familiar with the basic CSS shown. Let's break this down and figure out 
whats in front of us. 

### Under The Hood

A variable is created with the name of Header. It's value is just a function wearing a disguise. 
We write styled.div, as our component is simply a div. However, this could be an anchor, heading, 
or even a button if you'd like (styled.button). We then include a set 
of backticks which is where you'd begin to write regular CSS.

> Remember, this is still JSX so any component you define must start with a capital letter. Lowercase
 component names are used for built-in components.

 ### Piecing it together

The example above won't get you anywhere unless you have styled components added as a dependency and 
imported. To do so, open your terminal and run:

 ```
 npm install --save styled-components
 ```
 Once it's installed, head over to your component file and import styled components by adding the following:

```javascript
import styled from 'styled-components';
```

Now that we have that in place, you can use your new styled component. 

```javascript
import React from "react"
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Header = styled.div`
    display: flex;
    background: #fff;
    color: #000;
    height: 10rem;
    padding: 0.5rem;
`
const App = () => (
    <div>
        <Header /> 
    </div>
)

export default App
```
